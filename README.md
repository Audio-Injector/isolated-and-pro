# Auto Setup

Coming soon !

# Manual Setup

Make sure you have a recent enough firmware Kernel version 5.4.58 or later (4.19.xx later then 17th July) which includes the Isolated machine driver updates :

```
sudo rpi-update
```

Edit your /boot/config.txt file to disable dtparam=audio (the # below comments it out):
```
#dtparam=audio
```

Edit your /boot/config.txt file to enable the Ultra's device tree overlay :
```
dtoverlay=audioinjector-isolated-soundcard
```  

NOTE : If the card is showed as installed but you can't use it, double check it isn't a pulseaudio issue by removing pulseaudio from the system.
```sudo apt remove pulseaudio```

# Manual Setup bash command script :
```
sudo rpi-update
# firstly disable PWM audio
sed -i \"s/^\s*dtparam=audio/#dtparam=audio/\" /boot/config.txt
# now check to see the correct device tree overlay is loaded ...
cnt=`grep -c audioinjector-isolated-soundcard /boot/config.txt`
if [ "$cnt" -eq "0" ]; then
  echo '# enable the AudioInjector.net sound card
  dtoverlay=audioinjector-isolated-soundcard' >> /boot/config.txt
fi
```
